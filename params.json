To be able to shutdown the computer, you must be listed\r\nin the systems sudoers file, in particular, you must be allowed to execute\r\n$HELPER_PATH_PREFIX/xfce4/session/xfsm-shutdown-helper as user root (where\r\n$HELPER_PATH_PREFIX is the directory passed to configure with the\r\n--with-helper-path-prefix option or /usr/local/lib by default). \r\n\r\nFor example, you built xfce4-session with the default options, your hostname\r\nis myhost and your user account is named myuser, then you'd have to add\r\nthe following line to your sudoers file (remember to use visudo to edit\r\nthat file):\r\n\r\n  myuser\tmyhost=/usr/local/lib/xfce4/session/xfsm-shutdown-helper\r\n\r\nStarting with xfce4-session 4.3.99.2 xfce4-session will first try to use\r\nHAL (if built with D-Bus support) and fallback to the sudo method described\r\nabove. So if you have HAL installed on your system, and your account is\r\nallowed to shutdown/reboot the computer using HAL, you don't need to setup\r\nsudo at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegacy session management:\r\n--------------------------\r\nAs of version 4.1.7, the session manager includes native support for\r\napplications that don't support the X11R6 session management protocol,\r\nbut support legacy (X11R5) session management. If you don't need legacy\r\nsession management support, you can disable it at compile time, giving\r\n--disable-legacy-sm to ./configure.\r\n\r\nThe legacy sm code is ment as a replacement for smproxy (the X11 session\r\nmanagement proxy), which caused all kinds of trouble. That says, do NOT\r\nEVER run smproxy in session that is managed by xfce4-session, or weird\r\nthings will happen. The included legacy session management does everything\r\nthat smproxy would do, and besides that, it also support multiscreen\r\ndisplay and it is less error prone compared to smproxy (atleast once\r\nthe various bugs I introduced are fixed :-).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
